Data Cleaning and Processing System

Welcome to the Data Cleaning and Processing System repository. This project, built using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn, aims to enhance data quality and usability through various preprocessing techniques. The system is designed with scalability, performance, and compatibility in mind, ensuring efficient handling of large and diverse datasets.

Introduction

The Data Cleaning and Processing System aims to automate the preprocessing of raw data to improve its quality and usability. The system utilizes techniques such as outlier detection using IsolationForest, missing value imputation with numpy and pandas, and normalization using StandardScaler. It also includes mechanisms for data validation and visualization using matplotlib and seaborn to assist in quality control.

Features----

1.Outlier Detection: Identifies and handles outliers in the dataset using IsolationForest.

2.Missing Value Imputation: Fills in missing values using various strategies provided by numpy and pandas.

3.Normalization: Scales data to a standard range using StandardScaler.

4.Automation: Efficiently processes large datasets with minimal manual intervention.

5.Compatibility: Supports various data formats and structures.

6.Error Handling: Ensures data integrity with robust error handling mechanisms.

7.Data Validation: Provides options for validating data quality.

8.Visualization: Includes tools for visualizing data using matplotlib and seaborn to aid in quality control.

9.Scalability and Performance: Optimized for handling diverse data sources effectively.
